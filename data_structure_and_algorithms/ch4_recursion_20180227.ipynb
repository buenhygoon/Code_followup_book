    "- In computing recursion provides an elegant and powerful alternative for performing repetitive tasks. In fact, a few programming languages do not explicitly support looping constructs and instead rely directly on recursion to express repetition. Most modern programming languages support functional recursion using the identical mechanism that is used to support traditional forms of function calls. When one invovation of the function make a recursive call, that invocation is suspended until the recursive call completes."
