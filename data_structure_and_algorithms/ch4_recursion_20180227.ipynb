In fact, a few programming languages do not explicitly support looping constructs and instead rely directly on recursion to express repetition. Most modern programming languages support functional recursion using the identical mechanism that is used to support traditional forms of function calls. When one invovation of the function make a recursive call, that invocation is suspended until the recursive call completes."

As a major complew example of the use of recursion, consider how to draw the markings of a typical English ruler. For each inch, we place a tick with a numeric label. We denote the length of the tick designating a whole inch as the major tick length. Between the marks for whole inches, the ruler contains a series of minor ticks, placed at intervals of 1/2 inch, 1/4 inch, and so on. As the size of the interval decreases by half, the tick length decreases by one/. Figure 4.2 demonstrates several such rulers with varying major tick lengths."
