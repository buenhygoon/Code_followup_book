    "- Our implementation of the disk\\_usage function produces an identical result, when executed on the sample file system portrayed in Figure 4.7. During the execution of the algorithm, exactly one recursive call is made for each entry in the portion of the file system that is considered. Because the print statement is made just before returning from a recursive call, the output shown in Figure 4.8 reflects the order in which the recursive calls are completed. In particular, we begin and end a recursive call for each entry that is nested below another entry, computing the nested cumulative disk space before we can compute and report the cumulative disk space for the containing entry. For example, we do not know the cumulative total for entry /user/rt/courses/cs016 until after the recursive calls regarding contained entries grades, homeworks, and programs complete."

Stated another way, for each invocation of the function, we only account for the number of operations that are performed within the body of that activation. We can then account for the overall number of operations that are executed as part of the recursive algorithm by taking the sum, over all activations, of the number of operations that take place during each individual activation.

In general, we may rely on the intuition afforded by a recursion trace in recognizing how many recursive activations occur, and how the parameterization of each activation can be used to estimate the number of primitive operations that occur within the body of that activation. However, each of these recursive algorithms has a unique structure and form."
