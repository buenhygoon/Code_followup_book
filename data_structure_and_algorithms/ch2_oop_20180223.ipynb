    "- For objext-oriented programming, the design step is perhaps the most important phase in the processof developing software. For it is in the design step that we decide how to divide the working of our porgram into classes, we decide how these classes will interact, what data each will store, and what actions each will perform. Indeed, one of the main challenges that beginning programmers face is decising what classes to define to do the work of their program. While general prescriptions are hard to come by, there are some rules of thumb that we can apply when determining how to desing our classes :"
