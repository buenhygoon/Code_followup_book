    "- In this chapter, we explore Python's various \"sequence\" classes, namely the built-in list, tuple, and str classes. There is significant commonality between these classes, most notably: each supports indexing to access an individual element of sequence, using syntax such as seq[k], and each uses a low-level comcept knwon as an array to represent the sequence. However, there are significant differences in the abstractions that these classes represent, and in the way that instances of these classes are represented internally by Python. Because these classes are used so widely in PYthon programs, and because they will become building blocks upon which we will develop more complex data structures, it is imperative that we establish a clear understanding of both the public behavior and inner workings of these classes."

While the basic usage of lists, strings, and tuples may seem straightforward, there are several important subtleties regarding the behaviors associatedd with these classes (such as what it means to make a copy of a sequence, or to take a slice of a sequence). Having a misunderstanding of a behavior can easily lead to inadvertent bugs in a program. Therefore, we establish an accurate mental model for each of these classes. These images will help when exploring more advanced usage, such as representing a multidimensional data set as a list of lists."

While it is true that one only needs to understand the syntax and semantics of class's public interface in order to be able to write legal and corrct code that uses instances of the class, the efficiency of a program depends greatly on the efficiency of the components which it relies."

In effect, each byte of memory is associated with a unique number that serves as its address(more formally, the binary representation of the number serves as the address). In this way, the computer system can refer to the data in \"byte #2150\" versus the data in \"byte #2157\", for example. Memory addresses are typically coordinated with the physical layout of the memory system, and so we often portray the numbers in sequential fashion. Figure 5.1 provides such a diagram, with the designated memory address for each byte."

That is, it is just as easy to retrieve byte #8675309 as it is to retrieve byte #309.(In practice, there are complicating factors including the use of caches and external memory; we address some of those issues in Chapter 15.)

A common programming task is to keep track of a sequence of related objects. For example, we may want a video game to keep track of the top ten scores for that game.
