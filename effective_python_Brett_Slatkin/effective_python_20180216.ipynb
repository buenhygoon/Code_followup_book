    "- Packages in Python are modules that contain other modules. Packages allow you to organize your code into separate, non-conflicting namespaces with unique absolute module names.\n",

    "- You can provide an explicit API for a module by listing its publicly visible names in its \\_\\_all\\_\\_ special attribute.\n",
    "- You can hide a package's internal implementation by only importing public names in the package's \\_\\_init\\_\\_.py file or by naming internal-only members with a leading underscore.\n",
