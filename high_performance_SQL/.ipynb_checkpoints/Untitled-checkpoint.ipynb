    "MySQL is very different from other database servers, and its architectural characteristics make it useful for a wide range of purposes as well as making it a poor choice for others. MySQL is not perfect, but it is flexible enough to work well in very demanding environments, such as web applications. At the same time, MySQL can power embeded applications, data warehouses, content indexing and delivery software, highly available redundant systems, online transaction processing(OLTP) , and much more."
